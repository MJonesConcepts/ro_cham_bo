Ro Cham Bo

Ro Cham Bo is a simple, interactive Rock–Paper–Scissors web game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows a user to play against an automated opponent (“RO-Bot”) with real-time score tracking and visual feedback.

This project is designed as a lightweight browser game and as a demonstration of clean DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in vanilla JavaScript.

Features

Play Rock, Paper, or Scissors against an AI opponent

Randomized computer move selection

Live score tracking:

Wins

Losses

Ties

Persistent score storage using localStorage

Visual move display with icons

Reset score functionality

Responsive, minimalist UI

How It Works

The player selects a move by clicking a button.

RO-Bot randomly selects a move.

The game logic determines the outcome:

Win

Loss

Tie

Scores update immediately and are saved locally in the browser.

The selected moves are displayed using icons for visual clarity.

Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling and layout

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) – Game logic, DOM manipulation, and state management
